                    TERN wasnt built to chase AI trends; it was created to solve
                    a real problem. Co-founder and former special operator Brett
                    Harrison first saw the danger of contested GPS signals during
                    military operations in Afghanistan. Seeing those
                    vulnerabilities grow from daily frustrations to national
                    security risks, he partnered with AI entrepreneur Shaun
                    Moore, who led a team to built the worlds fastest facial
                    recognition system. Together, they united professional
                    navigators and top-tier AI engineers to create IDPS™, a
                    signal-independent navigation system born from lived
                    experience, not theory. That foundation, paired with a culture
                    of creative empowerment and mission-first thinking, has
                    enabled TERN to deliver a combat proven and U.S.
                    Department of Transportation tested, infrastructure-free
                    alternative to GPS that is already reshaping how the world
                    navigates.
